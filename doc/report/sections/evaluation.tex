% TODO
%
% - describe the structure of the test suite
% - is it necessary to describe machine specs for tests run?
%    I don't think so, we are not checking CPU time or machine-related data. ~Filippo
% - describe collected data (variables, clauses, models, ...)
% - desiderata: plot describing evolution of different versions of the front-end
% - arrogant: comparisons with data from other teams on same test suite.
